<p>
    My name is Matt Millican, a full-stack web developer, specializing in the ASP.NET [Core] ecosystem. My passion is
    building web apps to make the lives of others easier. I also enjoy working with Javascript frameworks, and cloud platforms.
</p>

<p>
    I have over 10 years of experience developing web applications. Currently, I lead the back end development team at 
    <a href="https://www.graydientcreative.com" target="_blank">Graydient Creative</a>, building infrastructure, apps and 
    services to power dozens of web sites. I also build and manage our AWS environments to power web sites and e-commerce platforms.
</p>

<p>
    When not coding, you'll probably find me spending time with family, working on my model railroad, golfing, or traveling.
