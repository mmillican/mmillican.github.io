<p>
    My name is Matt Millican, a full-stack web developer, specializing in the ASP.NET [Core] ecosystem. My passion is
    building web apps that make the lives of others easier. 
</p>

<p>
    I currently lead the back end development team at Graydient Creative, building applications and services to power
    web sites for the hospitality and experiential industries. 
</p>

<p>
    When I'm not coding, you can probably find me working on my model railroad, golfing, watching sports or traveling.
