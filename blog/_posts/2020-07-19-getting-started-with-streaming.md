For the past couple months, I've been going back and forth on whether or not I 
want to try doing live-coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/m2devdotnet). For
starters, I was trying to figure out _why_ I wanted to start live-coding. Is 
it something I just think is "cool?" Will it gain me more "attention" in the 
developer community? Will I become wildly famous by doing it? 

Sure, those things _might_ be true after some time, but frankly I don't think they are reasons
I _should_ start live coding. So, I sat on it for some time and see if it 
came up again, and it did. So I asked myself again why, and came up with these reasons
that I think it could be good for me:

- It would help me work on my presentation skills. It's not in-person, or the same 
as giving a presentation, but it's still "public speaking" which is something
I've wanted to get better at.
- I think it will help me think through things as I'm coding them. Often, we get
stuck on a problem and end up sitting, staring at a screen, making no progress.
Having people "watching" you will not only likely keep you motivated, but perhaps
your followers will be able to help you figure out that problem.
- Related to both of the previous points, I think it will help me explain both 
problems _and_ solutions better. I feel like I often have a good understanding 
of the "why" behind things, but then have a hard time articulating that to others.

## Surveying the land

To further "test" if this is something I actually wanted to do, I started watching
some live-coders that I've seen previously. This was primarily to find out:

- Do I think what they're doing is interesting? If it's boring, surely I won't be 
able to keep my own channel going (or even get it started). _(Hint: yes, it is interesting)_
- What do I like that they do and don't do?
- What things might I want to incorporate into my streams?
- What might the _commitment_ for getting into live-coding look like?

After a few weeks of watching a few of my favorites in 
the background, I gathered some thoughts and notes and decided it is infact something
I want to try.

## The setup

I have a tendency to like buying new toys (who doesn't, really?) so I asked 
myself what do I really _need_ to get started, so I did a little more 
research on this. [Jeff Fritz](https://jeffreyfritz.com/2017/12/live-streaming-101-my-setup/) 
and [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/GoodBetterBestCreatingTheUltimateRemoteWorkerWebcamSetupOnABudget.aspx) 
have some good blog posts talking about different options and the "necessities."
The TL;DR: you need a good webcam and a good microphone or headset. Again, I 
was trying to keep the cost relatively low, incase I decided live-coding isn't 
for me. Here's what I ultimately chose:

- [Logitech C920 HD Pro Webcam](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00829D0GM)
- [Mpow 3.5mm/USB Headset](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082HCX5X5)
- [Elgato Stream Deck - 15 key *](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKNZT1P)

_* Note: this was a splurge, I definitely did not need the Stream Deck to get started._

If I decide to stick with it, I'll probably buy a small green-screen, but I think 
this will be good to get started. You can always upgrade later, right?

The next thing you need is a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv) account, which is free! 
(Go sign up for one now!) You'll also need some sort of streaming software. The 
two main options are [Open Broadcasting Software](https://obsproject.com/) and [StreamLabs OBS](https://streamlabs.com/streamlabs-obs). 
StreamLabs OBS is built on top of OBS, with some additional "flair" features. 
For now, I chose to use straight OBS. I've spent the last week or so tinkering
with it. I'm _horrible_ with design, so it doesn't look pretty, but it will 
serve its purpose for now.

## Next steps

So what's next? Well, I need to get a few things organized both on my computer 
and my desk area to make it more conducive to streaming. I'm hoping sometime 
this week to do a test stream, working on one of my many "pet projects" to get 
a feel for it and make sure the tech works out okay.

From there, I'm planning on streaming just once a week for an hour or two. While 
it may not be the _ideal_ time, I'm thinking I would start at 9pm central time 
on Tuesday or Thursday evening. This will allow me to not interfere with work 
or family activities. 

I'll mostly streaming be ASP.NET Core related things 
with some Vue.js, Docker, cloud-y things as well. As I mentioned earlier, I always
have many pet projects going, so I'll try to pick one of those to stick with while 
streaming. Have anything special you'd like to see related to these technologies?

I hope this will be a fun journey, and will help me grow as a developer and 
presenter. Please [join me](https://twitch.tv/m2devdotnet) and feel free to 
share and tips, comments or feedback you may have!
