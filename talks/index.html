    <h2>Vue.js and ASP.NET Core</h2>

    <p>
        Vue.js is a light-weight, versatile and performant front-end framework for developing 
        user interfaces. One reason Vue is so popular is that it can be used within existing 
        applications or as a full SPA framework. In this talk, we're going to start by taking a 
        look at the basics of Vue such as two-way data binding, control statements and creating 
        custom components. From there we'll look at two ways that we can use Vue.js into ASP.NET 
        Core together. The first is adding Vue to existing Razor views to create a better user 
        experience. The second is building a Web API in ASP.NET Core and then using the Vue CLI to 
        create our application. During both of these examples and demos, I'll explain why Vue excels 
        at those particular use cases. In addition, we'll look at how you can use third party 
        components to streamline your development and further increase your app's user experience. 
        After this session, you will be able to discover new ways to implement Vue in both your existing 
        apps as well as for new development.
